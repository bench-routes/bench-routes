## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/zairza-cetb/bench-routes/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the template](https://github.com/zairza-cetb/bench-routes/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Request Process
1. Make a new branch for each feature/pull request. 
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. Ensure that the code follows the linting standards. `eslint`, `tslint` and `prettier` are used for the TypeScript files and `golint` is used for the Golang files. Use the command `make fix` to format the code.
4. Write appropriate comments in the pull request, explaining the changes made. This helps maintainers and the community understand the changes made by you and help review the PR. **Reference the issue you are fixing**.
5. For changes to the front-end include screenshots or screencasts showing the working changes. You can use browser extensiosns like `Screencastify` to create screencasts.
6. Make sure you submit some kind of proof of your fix that makes the reviewing process easier for the maintainers.
