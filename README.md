Modern web applications can have routes ranging from a few to millions in numbers. This makes it tough to discover then
condition and state of the such application at any given point. Bench-routes monitors the routes of a web application
and helps you know about the current state of each route, along with various related performance metrics.

### Dataflow

![Screenshot from 2020-03-21 20-09-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33792202/77228928-b139e900-6bb0-11ea-877b-54afffd2aa53.png)

### Primary goals
1. Monitoring web applications routes at scale.
2. Querying the monitored data in an interactive UI that is minimalistic to learn.
3. Reporting in case of any abnormalities.

## Use of MakeFile in bench-routes
We use `make` for building and executing the program.

Follow the commands to make the development process easier:

1. Updating the dependencies: `make update`
2. Executing the application (assuming all dependencies are installed): `make run`
2. Run UI (assuming all dependencies in `dashboard/v1.1` are installed): `make view-v1.1`
2. Building the application for the current OS: `make build`
3. Testing Golang code: `make test`
4. Complete testing include building for all OSs out there: `make test_complete`
5. Cleaning up the residual files: `make clean`
6. *(optional)* Check linting (assuming [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#install) is installed): `make lint`

## Postman Usage
1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and Install it.
2. Create a new collection.

`http://localhost:9990/service-state` 
4. Send the request to url.
5. This API returns the state of the services (active or passive) in real-time.

### To Get Routes Summary
1. Add request
2. Select method **GET**
3. Copy and Enter below request url  
`http://localhost:9990/routes-summary` 
4. Send the request to url.
